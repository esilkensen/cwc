Compilers for higher-order languages often transform programs into
continuation-passing style (CPS) form as an intermediate representation. In the
language of CPS terms, all procedures take a continuation argument $k$
that represents the ``rest of the computation;'' procedures apply $k$ to their
return value instead of returning directly. This form is beneficial to
compilers because it enables optimizations by way of simple $\beta$- and
$\eta$-reductions, and it simplifies code generation by resembling a low-level
target language.
% TODO: rewrite following sentence with more examples(?)
However, it comes at a cost: a na\"{\i}ve CPS transformation greatly expands a
program's size, which a realistic compiler must work to reduce.

\citet{Sabry:1992zr} observed that the transformation typically involves three
phases: compilers translate into CPS, simplify the result, and then undo the
CPS translation via a \textit{un}-CPS reduction.
%They showed how a set of so-called $A$-reductions applied directly to a source
%program yields a result equivalent to the combined effect of the CPS
%transformation. \citet{Flanagan:1993fk} clarified this correspondence by
%developing a sequence of abstract machines simulating the compilation of a
%Scheme-like language using both CPS and $A$-reduction strategies.
\citet{Flanagan:1993fk} forgo the need of CPS and \textit{un}-CPS translations
by developing an equivalent source level $A$-reduction. They construct abstract
machines simulating the compilation of a Scheme-like language via both CPS and
$A$-reduction strategies, and then prove their equivalence. With this, they
conclude that compilers using $A$-normal forms may enjoy the benefits of
CPS-based compilers without the overhead.

% TODO: expand on subtleties of models
While we understand their reasoning at a high level, we would like to grasp
the subtleties of the abstract machines and language transformations.
Towards that end, we plan to implement each machine and transformation
in Redex. By running executable models of the paper's mathematics on concrete
examples, we will gain a better understanding of how programs change throughout
the transformations, how modifications to the machines remove redundancies, and
the reasons for why it may be advantageous for a compiler to use $A$-reductions
instead of CPS.

% TODO: talk about bugs and A-reduction redex model
As a side effect, we also think this project will help us discover to how a
tool such as Redex is useful to programming language researchers in the
real world. For example, as we began implementing a model of the paper,
we noticed what seem to be two typos in the na\"{i}ve and inverse CPS
transformations. We were also puzzled by the definition of evaluation contexts
for the $A$-reductions and plan to check our understanding by implementing a
working model in Redex.

% Questions asked:
%  - how programs change throughout the transformations?
%  - how redundancies are removed from the machines?
%  - CPS vs A in a compiler (timing)?
%  - how to implement A-reductions algorithm?
%  - are there typos in the figures?
